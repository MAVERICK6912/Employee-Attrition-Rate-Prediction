# Employee Attrition rate prediction

>Employee attrition is a gradual but deliberate reduction in the number of employees in a company or business organization. Employees will at some point in time look to change their job places for a number of reasons. It might be for professional or personal reasons but it does happen.

So, an organisation need to keep in check the attrition rate so as to have a high performant workforce at all times.

This problem was a part of a hackathon organized by HackerEarth, I was able to get a **rank in the top 2%** of the participants.
